  The first steps after installation
  ==================================
  
  1. By default Sublimerge's colors theme conforms to default Sublime Text theme. If you are using some
     custom theme and find the colors poorly visible, you may need to change them.
  
  2. If you're on Windows and want to use VCS-related commands, you may need to configure the executable
     path for your VCS. Linux and OS X users with non-standard VCS installation may need to configure this too.
  
  
  Please visit http://www.sublimerge.com/sm3/docs/configuration.html for more information about configuration.
